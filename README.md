# Dack Compiler and Compiler Tutorial

## What is Dack?

Dack is also an alternate Nand2Tetris client for anyone else interested in learning about
the compilation process. It is less rigorous that the official course, requiring only
short segments of code at a time and skipping over the less interesting sections completely.
It tests user's solutions agains the tests privided by the official course, as well as
more difficult tests that find likely-buggy code.
